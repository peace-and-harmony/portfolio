## Project 1: [Image matting](https://peace-and-harmony.github.io/image-matting/)

_Adapted the architecture of MODNet to the domain of clothing matting, aiming to extract the clothing foreground object from daily photos, and to feed in a recommendation system later._

- Conducted image matting for the client. Trained deep learning model on 6.3G dataset to extract foreground objects.
- Improved accuracy and the new model reduced negative reviews from the app users and potentially increases the client's profit.
- Conducted inference benchmark tests on CPU via ONNX: 1.4X faster inference runtime. 
- TensorRT engine was generated based on simplified ONNX format which potentially speeds up inference on GPU.

## Project 2: [Topic modelling/evolution](https://peace-and-harmony.github.io/nature-articles-topic-modelling/)

_Uncover the topic evolution since 1886_

- Scraped ~20000 Nature research articles from 1886 to 2021.
- Performed EDA for the numerical data and found that the pandemic boosts the COVID-related research areas.
- Deployed Bertopic to investigate the evolution of Nature research article topics over 148 years.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/peace-and-harmony/portfolio/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
